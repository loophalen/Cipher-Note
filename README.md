<h1>Cipher Note</h1>

Cipher Note is a cryptocurrency tracker and note application. It is an express CRUD app built with NodeJS using HTML and Bootstrap. To store data it uses MongoDB. 

The intent of Cipher Note is to serve as an editable cryptocurrency tracker and message board where users can share ideas and trading strategies. 

<h2>Additional Features</h2>

I would like to add an API that serves as the index from which users can add specific curriences to their portfolio or watchlist.

Another feature to add is an API that aggreates specific news or tweets related to a specific currency.
